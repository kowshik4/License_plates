# License_plates
To detect license plate of  a vehicle in the image and extract characters in the license plate.

The .ipynb file contains code for detecting the license plate in the given image.And I also implemented on the dataset given to us.
The other Python files are code for identifying characters in the detected license plate.
The cropped image we get from the ipynb file will be given as input to the main.py file to identify characters.
